# 🎲 Tycoon — Monopoly Tycoon on Chain

## Overview

**Tycoon** is an exciting blockchain-based tycoon game inspired by the classic **Monopoly** board game.  
This version is built on the **Stellar Network** with **Soroban** smart contracts.

Players will be able to **buy, sell, and trade virtual properties as tokens/NFT-like assets**, collect rent, build monopolies, and compete in a **decentralized on-chain economy**  all powered by Stellar's fast, low-cost, and energy-efficient infrastructure.

This project combines **strategic gameplay** with **true ownership** and **transparent mechanics** using Soroban smart contracts.

> Smart contracts (Rust + Soroban), frontend, and game logic. Join the journey!

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

- 🏡 **Property Ownership** — Iconic Monopoly properties tokenized on Stellar (using Soroban contracts for ownership & transfers)  
- 💰 **Rent & Tycoon Mechanics** — Earn passive income; upgrade properties for higher yields  
- 🎲 **On-Chain Game Events** — Dice rolls, Chance cards, Community Chest, Tax, Jail — all handled transparently via smart contracts  
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** — Real-time board with rotatable cards (e.g., Income Tax 200 XLM equivalent, Luxury Tax 100)  
- ⚡ **Ultra-Efficient** — Powered by Stellar's ~3-5 second finality, sub-penny fees, and high throughput  
- 👛 **Wallet Integration** — Stellar wallets (e.g., Freighter, Albedo, Lobstr) + WalletConnect support planned
